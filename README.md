# ScoreBoard
Simple library to manage score board

This solution consists of two projects developed in vb.net:

1- ScoreBoardManager: ItÂ´s a DLL library that contains the classes and methods to manage the Score Board.

2- ScoreBoardTest: A desktop application to test the library. Its mode of use is as follows:

Step 1: Push button "Init Live Score" to load a scheduled mathes list.

Step 2: Push button "Send Event" to send to library a match event. If you press it repeatedly, it will send one by one a list of events, some of them wrong, until the 5 matches are completed.

Step 3: If we want to restart the process again, it is necessary to press the "Init Live Score" button again.
